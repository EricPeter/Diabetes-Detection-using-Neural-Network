Diabetes Mellitus (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Artificial Intelligence in Medicine papers must refer to real-world medical domains, considered and discussed at the proper depth, from both the technical and the medical points of view.

Data Science and Machine Learning is helping medical professionals make diagnosis easier by bridging the gap between huge data sets and human knowledge. We can begin to apply Machine L earning techniques for classification in a dataset that describes a population that is under a high risk of the onset of diabetes.

Given the medical data we can gather about people, we should be able to make better predictions on how likely a person is to suffer the onset of diabetes, and therefore act appropriately to help. We can start analyzing data and experimenting with algorithms that will help us study the onset of diabetes.
